This project is all about what type of ads do get clicked mostly and recently. This python project is done in Google Colab.

The following python modules are used to obtain the result: 

-> <b><i>pandas</i></b> : Pandas is an open source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks. It is built on top of another package named Numpy, which provides support for multi-dimensional arrays. As one of the most popular data wrangling packages, Pandas works well with many other data science modules inside the Python ecosystem, and is typically included in every Python distribution

-> <b><i>numpy</i></b> : NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

-> <b><i>matplotlib</i></b> : Matplotlib is an amazing visualization library in Python for 2D plots of arrays. Matplotlib is a multi-platform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack. Matplotlib comes with a wide variety of plots. Plots helps to understand trends, patterns, and to make correlations. Theyâ€™re typically instruments for reasoning about quantitative information.
